# CMPA 3301 Knowledge Base â€“ Hybrid Project Management System

This repository serves two primary purposes:  

1. **Academic Knowledge Base**  
   - Organizes all CMPA 3302 assignments, exercises, discussions, and projects.  
   - Meets Assignment 01 rubric requirements: 5â€“7 categories, index placeholders, homepage with working links.  

2. **Professional Practice Lab**  
   - Implements a **hybrid project management approach** aligned with PMIâ€™s PMBOK 6 and PMBOK 7.  
   - Provides hands-on practice managing scope, time, quality, and risks while adapting to uncertainty.  
   - Doubles as PMP exam preparation by reinforcing the 8 PMI performance domains and 5 process groups.

## ðŸ“š Main Topics

The knowledge base is organized into six major categories.  
Each folder has its own `index.md` and is linked here for navigation:  

- [[30-human-interface/index|Human Interface]]  
- [[20-development-approach-life-cycle/index|Development Approach & Life Cycle]]  
- [[02-syllabus/index|Syllabus]]  
- [[40-measurement/index|Measurement]]  
- [[10-assets/index|Assets]]  
- [[01-private/index|Private]]

## ðŸ“š Categories & Logic

- **human-interface/** â†’ Stakeholders & Team  
  - Captures communications, roles, and engagement.  
  - Domains: Stakeholders, Team.  

- **development-approach-life-cycle/** â†’ Development Approach & Integration  
  - Governance docs, lifecycle notes, templates, and ITTOs.  
  - Domains: Development Approach & Life Cycle, Delivery.  

- **syllabus/** â†’ Weekly Sprints  
  - Contains `wk1â€¦wk8/`, each structured into PMIâ€™s 5 Process Groups.  
  - Domains: Project Work, Planning, Measurement, Risk.  

- **measurement/** â†’ QA, Rubrics, Performance  
  - Stores rubric checks, performance reports, and metrics.  
  - Domain: Measurement.  

- **assets/** â†’ Media & Support Files  
  - Images, diagrams, and multimedia used in deliverables.  
  - Supports Delivery domain.  

- **private/** â†’ Drafts, WIP, Internal Docs  
  - Work not intended for publishing (excluded with `.gitignore`).  
  - Useful for experiments, scratch work, and ITTO templates.  

Together, these categories touch all 8 domains:  
**Stakeholders, Team, Development Approach, Planning, Project Work, Delivery, Measurement, Uncertainty/Risk.**

## ðŸ“Š Hybrid Project Management Approach

This repo is intentionally structured as a **Hybrid Project** using PMI best practices:

- **Semester (Macro Level) = Predictive / Waterfall**  
  - Fixed start and end (8 weeks).  
  - Known overall deliverable: a published knowledge base.  
  - Syllabus = project scope baseline.  

- **Weeks (Micro Level) = Adaptive / Agile Sprints**  
  - Scope is revealed only when weekly assignments are posted.  
  - Each week = **Sprint** (Mondayâ€“Sunday timebox).  
  - Weekly backlog = assignments, exercises, discussions.  
  - Work flows through **Initiating â†’ Planning â†’ Executing â†’ Monitoring & Controlling â†’ Closing** in a 7-day cycle.  
  - Each Sunday = Sprint Closing (deliverables accepted + archived, lessons learned captured).  

This structure allows the repo to **handle uncertainty adaptively at the week level** while still **driving to a fixed outcome at the semester level**.

## ðŸ”„ Weekly Sprint Workflow

Each `wk#` folder is structured into PMIâ€™s **5 Process Groups**:

1. **Initiating/** â†’ Business Case, Charter, Stakeholder Register.  
2. **Planning/** â†’ Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Risk.  
3. **Executing/** â†’ Deliverables (assignments, discussions, exercises).  
4. **Monitoring-Controlling/** â†’ QA, rubric checks, change logs.  
5. **Closing/** â†’ Archive deliverables, Lessons Learned, Integration Notes.  

At the end of each Sprint (Sunday):  
- Deliverables are **accepted** and **archived**.  
- Lessons and risks are **documented**.  
- Performance is **measured**.  
- Knowledge is integrated into long-term systems (100_ttu_knowledge_base, DragonEye KMS).

## âœ… End State

At the end of 8 weeks:  
- The repo serves as a **published knowledge base** (final project deliverable).  
- Each week is fully documented as a **mini-project Sprint**, with initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closing completed.  
- The semester is **closed** as a predictive project, archived and integrated into long-term governance systems.
