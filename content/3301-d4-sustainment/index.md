# D4 Sustainment Explained

This ReadMe explains the **Sustainment Delta Lane**.

## What is D4 – Sustainment?

D4–Sustainment is the **support lane** of the DELTA system. It provides the tools, templates, and references that make it possible to sustain academic operations.  

Where D3–Workspace is about doing the work, D4 provides the *resources and supports* needed to keep that work efficient, consistent, and recoverable.  

---
## How it works

Sustainment organizes resources into three main areas:  
- [[d1-personal/private/templates/index|Templates]] → Document templates, ITTO models, and standardized forms for reuse.  
- [[d6-systems-integration/technical-guides/index|Guides]] → Quick references, checklists, and navigation aids.  
- [[3301-d4-sustainment/3301-d41-support/index|Support Notes]] → Technical support, troubleshooting, and contact references (linking to Stakeholders when required).  

Together these ensure that students always have access to the right resources without having to rebuild them from scratch.  

---
## When to employ it

Use D4–Sustainment whenever you need:  
- A template to build a new assignment deliverable.  
- Quick instructions or checklists for repeating common tasks.  
- Support materials to troubleshoot technical or academic issues.  

---
## Similarities to Other Delta Lanes

- Like D0 (Compliance), it provides **standards** — but here in reusable forms and templates.  
- Like D5 (Workflow), it supports **repeatability** — but through tools rather than operational rhythms.  
- Like D7 (Learning), it provides **resources for improvement** — but focused on sustaining operations, not experimenting with new methods.  

---
## Distinctions from Other Delta Lanes

- **D0 – Compliance:** Defines the rules; D4 provides *tools* for applying them.  
- **D3 – Workspace:** Executes assignments; D4 supplies the *resources* for that execution.  
- **D7 – Learning:** Experiments with new methods; D4 anchors the *stable resources* students can always return to.  

Analogy: **D0 is policy, D5 is rhythm, D4 is the toolbox.**

---
## Purpose of D4 – Sustainment

The purpose of D4 is to ensure that all academic and project work is **sustainable, efficient, and resilient**.  

It guarantees that:  
- Students have templates and guides ready for reuse.  
- Common issues are documented and easy to resolve.  
- The repo remains a consistent, reliable workspace over time.
