# D35 – Future Operations Portal  

This index page is the **navigational entry point for the 35–future operations sub-lane of d3–workspace.**  

Future operations is for **planning academic operations more than seven days into the future but less than the end of the semester.**  

Its scope is limited to this class: building out schedules and planning for upcoming events, assignments, or longer-term projects that go beyond weekly execution.  

Plans created here are handed forward to **30 – current operations** in workspace for execution.
