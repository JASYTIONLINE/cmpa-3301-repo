# D35 Future Operations ReadMe

This readme explains the **future operations sub-lane (D35) of  D3 Workspace.** future operations is for **planning operations more than seven days into the future but less than the end of the semester.**  

The scope is limited to **this class**. This is where I plan the semester’s longer-term events, assignments, and projects before they move into **30 – current operations** for execution.

## What is D35  Future Operations?

future operations is the **planning cell** of workspace. it looks ahead to upcoming events within the semester, but outside the current week.  

Examples:  
- planning how to handle the next few weeks of assignments.  
- creating a semester timeline.  
- preparing a long-term project roadmap.  

once these plans are ready, they flow into **30 – current operations** in workspace to be carried out.  

---

## When to Employ It

- use D35–future operations when i need to:  
- plan for an assignment, event, or project that is **beyond seven days away**.  
- map out deliverables for the **rest of the semester**.  
- prepare long-term schedules or strategies that current operations will later execute.  

---

## Similarities to Other Workspace Sub-lanes

 - Like **D30 – current operations**, it is about execution rhythm — but D35 is forward-looking planning, not execution.  
- Like **D30 workflow (within D3 workspace)**, it defines how work will flow — but future ops sets the plan before workflow is applied.  


---

## Distinctions from Other Workspace Sub-lanes

- **D30 – Current operations:** carries out tasks; 35 plans those tasks in
advance.  
- **D33 Workflow:** defines rhythm; 35 establishes the forward-looking
schedule workflow applies to.  
- **D7 – Learning:** captures lessons; 35 applies those lessons into
future plans.  

Analogy: **D35 drafts the playbook, D30 runs the plays.**

## Purpose of D35 Future Operations

The purpose of future operations is to ensure i always have a **forward plan** beyond the current week.  

It guarantees that:  
- longer-term projects and assignments have a roadmap.  
- semester planning is stored in one place.  
- execution in 30 – current operations has clear guidance to follow.
