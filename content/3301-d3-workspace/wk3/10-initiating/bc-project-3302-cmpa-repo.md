Excellent — that’s exactly the detail I needed to build a solid **Business Case**. Let me play it back to you in structured form so you can see how it would read if we dropped it into your repo as the **Business Case artifact** (probably under `scope-and-requirements/business-case.md`).

# **Business Case – CMPA 3302 Knowledge Base Repo**

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a knowledge base in GitHub (Markdown-only, Quartz-compatible) that achieves **100% on all CMPA 3302 assignments**. The repo is the core project deliverable. Its success is defined by full marks across all graded work in this course.

### Problem / Opportunity

* **Problem:** Without a structured system, course assignments risk being inconsistent, incomplete, or misaligned with rubric expectations. This could prevent earning full credit.
* **Opportunity:** By creating a reusable knowledge base aligned with both the CMPA 3302 course requirements and PMI terminology, the student not only maximizes the likelihood of earning 100% but also builds a system that can be duplicated for future courses.

### Expected Benefits

* **Primary Benefit:** Achieve 100% marks in CMPA 3302 by ensuring all assignments are fully completed, properly formatted, and organized in a single, consistent system.
* **Secondary Benefits:**

  * Reinforce PMI project management principles in all artifacts.
  * Prepare for PMP certification by practicing PMI terminology and methodology.
  * Demonstrate a repeatable governance system (DERIMS/Quartz-based) that can be cloned for future courses.
  * Build portfolio artifacts that show not only academic completion but also professional governance and knowledge management capability.

### Strategic Alignment

* **Course Requirement Alignment:** Fulfills CMPA 3302’s assignment and project deliverables.
* **TTU Knowledge Base Alignment:** Repo integrates into the **330X parent knowledge base** as a subsidiary repo, with shared resources stored in the TTU knowledge base. No crosstalk between 3301 and 3302 beyond shared resources.
* **DERIMS Alignment:** Repo structure maps to DragonEye Records Management principles and stays consistent with the parent tree, with exceptions where required (e.g., Quartz forcing `content/` instead of numbered folders).

### Constraints & Exceptions

* **Formatting:** All artifacts must be in Markdown for proper rendering in GitHub/Quartz.
* **Numbering Exception:** While DERIMS normally applies a numbering convention, Quartz requires `content/` folder names. Therefore, this project will use Quartz naming where mandated but retain DERIMS logic where possible. Assets may be exempt from numbering.
* **Time:** All artifacts must be completed within course deadlines to ensure assignments receive credit.

### Stakeholders

* **Primary:** Instructor (grader, customer).
* **Secondary:** Student (project manager and user of the system).
* **Tertiary:** Future self (portfolio reuse, duplicating the system for other courses).
* **Supportive:** ChatGPT (AI collaborator and documentation enforcer).

### Success Criteria

* **Definition of Success:** Repo earns **100% marks in CMPA 3302**.
* **Additional Success Criteria:**

  * Repo is duplicable for future courses.
  * Repo maintains alignment with PMI terminology and CHATS artifact governance.
  * Repo ties cleanly into the 330X TTU Knowledge Base without crosstalk into CMPA 3301.
  * Repo is Quartz/Markdown-compliant and fully functional as a static site.

### Recommendation

Proceed with the project by establishing a **governance-first information architecture** (Governance + 6 subordinate categories + Templates). This ensures compliance with the instructor’s requirements while reinforcing PMI methodology and building a duplicable system for future academic projects.

That is your Business Case as a draft. It’s strong because it:

* Justifies the repo in **customer (instructor) terms**: 100% on all assignments.
* Adds **secondary, professional benefits** (PMI practice, repeatable system).
* Addresses **constraints** (Quartz naming vs DERIMS numbering).
* Defines **success** in measurable terms (full marks + duplicable system).

Do you want me to now draft the **Scope Statement** artifact in the same format — so you’ve got both Business Case and Scope as the first two deliverables for this project?
