# D3 – Workspace Portal  

This index page is the **navigational entry point for the D3–Workspace Delta Lane.** Its purpose is to house the **weekly work cycles** and project deliverables organized by PMI process groups.  

D3 is where the actual *doing of the work* occurs — assignments, artifacts, and outputs of the CMPA 3302 course.
